Automatically base64 encodes media images on your site.

== Description ==
Base64 Images is a simple plugin to encode your media images on your site. Base64 encoding of images can have some [SEO benefits](https://varvy.com/pagespeed/base64-images.html) for your site.

The plugin is as unobtrusive as possible: activate it, and media images are encoded. Deactivate it, and they are not. No settings, no gunk left in your database. * It hooks into WordPress approved hooks and filters to do its job.

(* There is some caching used for speed benefits, but the cached data will be totally removed when you uninstall the plugin completely.)

== Installation ==
Install like any other plugin, directly from your plugins page.

Activate the plugin - and that\'s all there is to it!

== Screenshots ==
1. Plugin deactivated: image loads from the \"uploads\" folder.
2. Plugin activated: image no longer loads separately. Instead, it is embedded in the page\'s source.
